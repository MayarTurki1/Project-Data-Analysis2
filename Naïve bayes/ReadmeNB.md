Introduction:

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains several medical attributes that are used to train models to predict the likelihood of heart disease. The project includes data analysis, visualizations, model building, and evaluation of different algorithms.

The following steps are included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Model building using classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and other metrics
